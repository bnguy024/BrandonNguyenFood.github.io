                    <p><blockquote> My name is Brandon Nguyen and I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year computer science student at the University of Calgary.<br> 
                    Born and raise in Calgary with nothing to do, I've was drawn to Japanese culture from a very young age.<br> Wanting toexperience Japan 
                first hand I decided to study abroad in Kyoto for one year. During my study <br>abroad, I learned the true taste of Japanese food.
                There I learned that there is more food diversity and began <br> eating my way around Japan.</blockquote> </p>

                    <p><blockquote>I believe that food experiences should be shared and enjoyed by all. I believe that what us westerns know<br>about Japanese
                    food is very limited and I want to let the world know about the lesser known Japanese dishes.<br> There is unique diversity when it comes to
                    Japanese food. They take influence from various regions and my it <br> their own. Although these dishes are not famous, I am certain
                    that with one bite everyone will be instantly hooked.</blockquote>
